## Introduction

This Movie Recommender System is built using Python and leverages the Pandas library for data manipulation, Seaborn for visualization, and collaborative filtering techniques to provide movie recommendations to users. The system is designed to recommend movies based on user ratings and preferences.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

 Python 3.x installed on your system
 Required Python packages (NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn) installed
 Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for running the code interactively)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/seetharamarao817/movie-recommender.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd movie-recommender
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the necessary data files in the project directory:

   - rate.data.csv: Movie rating data
   - movies.csv: Movie titles and genres data

2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook Movie_Recommender_System.ipynb to generate movie recommendations and explore the system interactively.

3. You can also integrate the recommender system code into your own Python project by importing the necessary functions and classes from the notebook.

## Data Sources

- The movie rating data (rate.data.csv) contains user ratings for various movies, including user IDs, movie IDs, ratings, and timestamps.

- The movie titles and genres data (movies.csv) contain information about movie titles and their corresponding genres.

## Algorithm

The recommender system in this project utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to provide movie recommendations. It calculates the similarity between movies and recommends movies based on a user's historical ratings and preferences.
